# Hospital Management System
Hospital   Management   System   (HMS)   is   designed   for   multispecialty   hospitals,   to cover   a   wide   range   of   hospital   administration   and   management   processes   of patient-centric   systems.   It   is   an   integrated   end-to-end   Hospital   Management   System that   provides   relevant   information   across   the   hospital   to   support   effective   decision making   of   patient   data,   and   hospital   administration,   in   a   seamless   flow. 

## Purpose 
The   primary   motivation   behind   composing   this   coursework   is   to   build   up   a   program   in python,   utilizing   loop   concept   as   well   as   file   read   and   write   for   the   given   scenario   of   a hospital.   The   program   can   be   easily   used   by   any   hospital   to   manage   their   patient data   and   administration. 

## Problem statement 
 
The   issue   offered   was   to   build   up   an   application   which   takes   inputs   and   show   the data   accessible.   After   that   the   program   should   write  the   data   in   a   csv.   Likewise,   after each   input,   it   should   be   refreshed   in   the   same   csv   file. 

## Aim and objectives

The   fundamental   focus   of   this   coursework   is   to   take   in   the   idea   of   programming   in python   and   can   compose   a   program   for   the   given   command.   Similarly,   another   target of   this   coursework   is   learning   the   concept   of   file   read   and   write   in   python programming   language   and   know  the   looping   in   python.   To   achieve   this   aim   will   be made   to   finish   all   the   work   in   the   given   time   frame. 

## Scope of the project 

This   undertaking   outlines   the   thoughts   and   techniques   for   composing   programs   in pythons   utilizing   loop   concept.   It   additionally   comprises   source  code,   flowchart   and reference   of   the   program.   Therefore,   this   undertaking   will   be   extremely   useful   for every   one   of   those   understudies,   programmer   and   python   learner   students   to discover   how   the   code   executes   and   works   in   the   program. 

## Features of the project 

The   features   of   this   program   as   follows; 

1. To   build   a   program   which   works   in   a   loop   statement   and   shows   accessible items   which   are   stored   in   a   csv   file.   The  program   should   wait   for   the   user   to enter   patient   details   of   interest.   Programs   should   not   close   or   stop   until   and unless   the   user   chooses   to   do   as   such. 

2. Program   had   a   user   interaction   feature   which   requested   every   question   with the   customer   and   reacted   to   that   answer  provided   by   the   customer. 

3. Program   had   an   exception   handling   feature   which   is   used   when   an unexpected   input   from   a   user.   Like,   the   program   expects   the   integer   value from   the   customer   but   the   customer   entered   a   string   value   then   the   program requested   for   integer   value. 

4. Interconnect   the   different   modules   in   the   main   module   for   easy   to   run   the   full program.   Like,   add_patients,   view_patients,   update_patients,   search_patients, delete_patients   and   quit   modules   are   connected   within   the   main   module. 

5. Program   can   read   csv   files   and   overwrite   or   write   new   csv   files.   In   this program.
